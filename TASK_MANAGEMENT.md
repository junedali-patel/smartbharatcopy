# Task Management System

## Overview
The Smart Bharat app now includes a comprehensive task management system that stores tasks in Firebase Firestore, linked to user profiles. This ensures that tasks persist across devices and are securely stored in the cloud.

## Features

### üîê **User-Specific Tasks**
- Tasks are automatically linked to the logged-in user
- Users can only see and manage their own tasks
- Secure Firestore rules ensure data privacy

### üì± **Real-time Synchronization**
- Tasks sync in real-time across all devices
- Changes are immediately reflected in the database
- Offline support with automatic sync when connection is restored

### üéØ **Task Categories**
- **Farming**: Agricultural and farming-related tasks
- **Personal**: Personal and family tasks
- **General**: General tasks and reminders

### ‚ö° **Priority Levels**
- **High**: Urgent tasks that need immediate attention
- **Medium**: Standard priority tasks
- **Low**: Non-urgent tasks

### üó£Ô∏è **Voice Commands**
- Add tasks using voice commands
- Natural language processing for task creation
- Automatic category and priority detection

### üìÖ **Due Date & Time**
- Set specific due dates and times for tasks
- Automatic reminder scheduling
- Visual indicators for overdue tasks

## Database Structure

### Tasks Collection
```javascript
{
  id: "auto-generated-document-id",
  userId: "user-firebase-uid",
  title: "Task title",
  priority: "high" | "medium" | "low",
  category: "farming" | "personal" | "general",
  dueDate: "2024-01-15",
  dueTime: "14:30",
  completed: false,
  createdAt: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  updatedAt: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Security Rules

### Firestore Security
- Users can only access their own tasks
- Tasks are automatically linked to the authenticated user
- No cross-user data access is possible

```javascript
// Tasks collection security rules
match /tasks/{taskId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
    (resource == null || resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid) &&
    (request.resource == null || request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid);
}
```

## Usage

### Adding Tasks
1. **Manual Input**: Type task details in the input field
2. **Voice Command**: Use the microphone button and speak your task
3. **Auto-detection**: The system automatically detects:
   - Priority from keywords (urgent, important, low)
   - Category from context (farming, personal, general)
   - Due dates from natural language (today, tomorrow, next week)

### Managing Tasks
- **Complete**: Tap the checkbox to mark as done
- **Delete**: Tap the trash icon to remove a task
- **Clear All**: Use the "Clear All" button to delete all tasks
- **Filter**: Use category filters to view specific task types

### Voice Commands Examples
- "Add urgent farming task to water crops tomorrow"
- "Remind me to buy groceries today"
- "Create low priority personal task to call mom next week"
